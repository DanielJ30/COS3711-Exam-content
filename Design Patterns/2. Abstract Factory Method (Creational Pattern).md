The same UI elements in a cross-platform application are expected to behave similarly, but look a little bit different under different operating systems. Moreover, it’s your job to make sure that the UI elements match the style of the current operating system. You wouldn’t want your program to render macOS controls when it’s executed in Windows.

The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of creation methods that the client code can use to produce different types of UI elements. Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create the UI elements that match that particular OS.

It works like this: when an application launches, it checks the type of the current operating system. The app uses this information to create a factory object from a class that matches the operating system. The rest of the code uses this factory to create UI elements. This prevents the wrong elements from being created.

With this approach, the client code doesn’t depend on concrete classes of factories and UI elements as long as it works with these objects via their abstract interfaces. This also lets the client code support other factories or UI elements that you might add in the future.

As a result, you don’t need to modify the client code each time you add a new variation of UI elements to your app. You just have to create a new factory class that produces these elements and slightly modify the app’s initialization code so it selects that class when appropriate.

### 2. Abstract Factory Pattern (Creational)

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

```c++
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QDebug>
#include <QString>

// Shape Interface
class Shape {
public:
    virtual ~Shape() {}
    virtual QString draw() = 0;
};

// Concrete Shape Classes
class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    QString draw() override {
        return "Drawing a rectangle";
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    QString draw() override {
        return "Drawing a circle";
    }
};

// Color Interface
class Color {
public:
    virtual ~Color() {}
    virtual QString fill() = 0;
};

// Concrete Color Classes
class Red : public Color {
public:
    QString fill() override {
        return "Filling with red color";
    }
};

class Blue : public Color {
public:
    QString fill() override {
        return "Filling with blue color";
    }
};

// Abstract Factory
class AbstractFactory {
public:
    virtual Shape* createShape() = 0;
    virtual Color* createColor() = 0;
};

// Concrete Factories
class ShapeFactory : public AbstractFactory {
public:
    Shape* createShape() override {
        return new Rectangle();
    }
    Color* createColor() override {
        return nullptr; // This factory doesn't deal with colors
    }
};

class ColorFactory : public AbstractFactory {
public:
    Shape* createShape() override {
        return nullptr; // This factory doesn't deal with shapes
    }
    Color* createColor() override {
        return new Blue();
    }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    // Create a shape using the shape factory
    AbstractFactory* shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
    Shape* shape = shapeFactory->createShape();
    if (shape) {
        qDebug() << shape->draw();
        delete shape;
    }
    delete shapeFactory;

    // Create a color using the color factory
    AbstractFactory* colorFactory = new ColorFactory();
    Color* color = colorFactory->createColor();
    if (color) {
        qDebug() << color->fill();
        delete color;
    }
    delete colorFactory;

    return a.exec();
}
```
