The command objects act as caretakers. They fetch the editor’s memento before executing operations related to commands. When a user attempts to undo the most recent command, the editor can use the memento stored in that command to revert itself to the previous state.

The memento class does not declare any public fields, getters or setters. Therefore no object can alter its contents. Mementos are linked to the editor object that created them. This lets a memento restore the linked editor’s state by passing the data via setters on the editor object. Since mementos are linked to specific editor objects, you can make your app support several independent editor windows with a centralized undo stack.

### Question 4.2
The following `VaccineMemento` class has been used to provide run-time backup for the
vaccine list. However, it is leading to errors. Rewrite the code so that the errors are fixed
and the classic memento pattern is implemented. (2)
```c++
class VaccineMemento
{
private:
    VaccineMemento();
    QList<QStringList> getState();
    void setState(QList<QStringList> v);
};
```

#### 4.2 - Answer
```c++
class VaccineMemento
{
private:
	friend class VaccineList;			// Declare Originator friend
	VaccineMemento();
	QList<QStringList> getState();
	void setState(QList<QStringList> v);
	QList<QStringList> list; 			// Add list to store state
};
```


### Memento related questions:

# October-November 2022
### Question 4.2
Suppose there is a GUI class (which is the main user interface), and a MyModelView
class that implements the model-view approach proposed in this question. If you were
to use the Memento pattern to set up a backup and restore facility for MyModelView,
answer the following questions.

### Question 4.2.1
Which class would create the memento? (1)

#### 4.2.1 - Answer
```text
Originator - MyModelView.
Calls createMemento() method to instantiate a ChocolateMemento object.
Caretaker initiates the process.
```

### Question 4.2.2
Which class would contain the data that is to be backed up? (1)

#### 4.2.2 - Answer
```text
Originator - MyModelView (Model manages data, not the view).
Data is actually stored in the Memento itself.
```

### Question 4.2.3
Which class would hold on to the created memento? (1)

#### 4.2.3 - Answer
```text
Caretaker - MainGUI
```

### 4. Memento (Behavioral Pattern)

The Memento design pattern is used to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. It is particularly useful for implementing mechanisms such as undo mechanisms.

```c++
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QDebug>
#include <QString>
#include <QStack>

// Memento class to hold the editor state
class Memento {
public:
    Memento(const QString& state) : state(state) {}
    QString getState() const {
        return state;
    }
private:
    QString state;
};

// Originator class (TextEditor)
class TextEditor {
public:
    TextEditor() : content("") {}
    void write(const QString& words) {
        content += words;
    }
    QString read() const {
        return content;
    }
    Memento save() const {
        return Memento(content);
    }
    void restore(const Memento& memento) {
        content = memento.getState();
    }
private:
    QString content;
};

// Caretaker class
class Caretaker {
public:
    void undo(TextEditor& editor) {
        if (!savedStates.isEmpty()) {
            editor.restore(savedStates.pop());
        }
    }
    void saveState(const TextEditor& editor) {
        savedStates.push(editor.save());
    }
private:
    QStack<Memento> savedStates;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    TextEditor editor;
    Caretaker caretaker;

    editor.write("First sentence. ");
    qDebug() << "Content: " << editor.read();

    caretaker.saveState(editor);
    editor.write("Second sentence. ");
    qDebug() << "Content: " << editor.read();

    caretaker.saveState(editor);
    editor.write("Third sentence. ");
    qDebug() << "Content: " << editor.read();

    caretaker.undo(editor);
    qDebug() << "After undo: " << editor.read();

    caretaker.undo(editor);
    qDebug() << "After another undo: " << editor.read();

    return a.exec();
}

```
