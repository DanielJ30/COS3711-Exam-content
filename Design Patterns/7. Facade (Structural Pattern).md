## 7. Facade (Structural Pattern)

![DesignPattern_Facade.jpg](..%2FResources%2FDesignPattern_Facade.jpg)
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade

`Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.`

### Problem:
```text
Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated 
library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of 
dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on.

As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation 
details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.
```

### Solution:
```text
A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of 
moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem 
directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has 
dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.

For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially 
use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the 
single method encode(filename, format). After creating such a class and connecting it with the video 
conversion library, you’ll have your first facade.
```

### Implementation
```c++
/**
 * The Subsystem can accept requests either from the facade or client directly.
 * In any case, to the Subsystem, the Facade is yet another client, and it's not
 * a part of the Subsystem.
 */
class Subsystem1 {
 public:
  std::string Operation1() const {
    return "Subsystem1: Ready!\n";
  }
  // ...
  std::string OperationN() const {
    return "Subsystem1: Go!\n";
  }
};
/**
 * Some facades can work with multiple subsystems at the same time.
 */
class Subsystem2 {
 public:
  std::string Operation1() const {
    return "Subsystem2: Get ready!\n";
  }
  // ...
  std::string OperationZ() const {
    return "Subsystem2: Fire!\n";
  }
};

/**
 * The Facade class provides a simple interface to the complex logic of one or
 * several subsystems. The Facade delegates the client requests to the
 * appropriate objects within the subsystem. The Facade is also responsible for
 * managing their lifecycle. All of this shields the client from the undesired
 * complexity of the subsystem.
 */
class Facade {
 protected:
  Subsystem1 *subsystem1_;
  Subsystem2 *subsystem2_;
  /**
   * Depending on your application's needs, you can provide the Facade with
   * existing subsystem objects or force the Facade to create them on its own.
   */
 public:
  /**
   * In this case we will delegate the memory ownership to Facade Class
   */
  Facade(
      Subsystem1 *subsystem1 = nullptr,
      Subsystem2 *subsystem2 = nullptr) {
    this->subsystem1_ = subsystem1 ?: new Subsystem1;
    this->subsystem2_ = subsystem2 ?: new Subsystem2;
  }
  ~Facade() {
    delete subsystem1_;
    delete subsystem2_;
  }
  /**
   * The Facade's methods are convenient shortcuts to the sophisticated
   * functionality of the subsystems. However, clients get only to a fraction of
   * a subsystem's capabilities.
   */
  std::string Operation() {
    std::string result = "Facade initializes subsystems:\n";
    result += this->subsystem1_->Operation1();
    result += this->subsystem2_->Operation1();
    result += "Facade orders subsystems to perform the action:\n";
    result += this->subsystem1_->OperationN();
    result += this->subsystem2_->OperationZ();
    return result;
  }
};

/**
 * The client code works with complex subsystems through a simple interface
 * provided by the Facade. When a facade manages the lifecycle of the subsystem,
 * the client might not even know about the existence of the subsystem. This
 * approach lets you keep the complexity under control.
 */
void ClientCode(Facade *facade) {
  // ...
  std::cout << facade->Operation();
  // ...
}
/**
 * The client code may have some of the subsystem's objects already created. In
 * this case, it might be worthwhile to initialize the Facade with these objects
 * instead of letting the Facade create new instances.
 */

int main() {
  Subsystem1 *subsystem1 = new Subsystem1;
  Subsystem2 *subsystem2 = new Subsystem2;
  Facade *facade = new Facade(subsystem1, subsystem2);
  ClientCode(facade);

  delete facade;

  return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```text
Facade initializes subsystems:
Subsystem1: Ready!
Subsystem2: Get ready!
Facade orders subsystems to perform the action:
Subsystem1: Go!
Subsystem2: Fire!
```
