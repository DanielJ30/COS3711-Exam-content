The base `Dialog` class uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently. 
A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.

When the factory method comes into play, you donâ€™t need to rewrite the logic of the `Dialog` class 
for each operating system. If we declare a factory method that produces buttons inside the base 
`Dialog` class, we can later create a subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory 
method. The subclass then inherits most of the code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory 
method, can render Windows-looking buttons on the screen.

For this pattern to work, the base `Dialog` class must work with abstract buttons: a base class or 
an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This way the code within Dialog remains functional, 
whichever type of buttons it works with.
Of course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory 
method you add to the `Dialog`, you get closer to the Abstract Factory pattern.

### Question 3.2
Write the class definition for the class that would be used to implement this design pattern
based on the scenario at the start of this question. (4)

#### 3.2 Answer:
```c++

#ifndef CHOCOLATEFACTORY_H
#define CHOCOLATEFACTORY_H

#include "chocolate.h"

#include <QString>
#include <QVariant>


class ChocolateFactory
{
public:
    ChocolateFactory();

    // QVariant will allow us to capture any datatype
    // It has also been provided a default value of -1 for checking the input in the various constructors
    Chocolate* createChocolate(QString type, QString name, QString vStatus, QVariant item = -1);
};

#endif // CHOCOLATEFACTORY_H
```

### 1. Factory method Pattern (Creational)

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is commonly used in libraries and frameworks where implementation details are expected to be extended by client code

```c++
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QDebug>
#include <QString>

// Base class for all shapes
class Shape {
public:
    virtual ~Shape() {}
    virtual QString draw() = 0;
};

// Rectangle class
class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    QString draw() override {
        return "Drawing a rectangle";
    }
};

// Circle class
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    QString draw() override {
        return "Drawing a circle";
    }
};

// ShapeFactory class - This is the Factory Method
class ShapeFactory {
public:
    enum ShapeType {
        RECTANGLE,
        CIRCLE
    };

    static Shape* createShape(ShapeType type) {
        Shape *shape = nullptr;

        switch (type) {
            case RECTANGLE:
                shape = new Rectangle();
                break;
            case CIRCLE:
                shape = new Circle();
                break;
        }

        return shape;
    }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    // Create Rectangle
    Shape *rectangle = ShapeFactory::createShape(ShapeFactory::RECTANGLE);
    if (rectangle) {
        qDebug() << rectangle->draw();
        delete rectangle;
    }

    // Create Circle
    Shape *circle = ShapeFactory::createShape(ShapeFactory::CIRCLE);
    if (circle) {
        qDebug() << circle->draw();
        delete circle;
    }

    return a.exec();
}

```
