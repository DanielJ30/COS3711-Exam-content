## Case:
There are many who make the argument that climate change is going to affect weather patterns,
and, thus, the amount of rainfall that is going to fall. Some may get more, while others will get
less. Tracking rainfall is, therefore, an important task.
For the sake of this scenario, you may assume the following about designing an application that
tracks rainfall.
- Rain data is stored using 3 pieces of data: the station that recorded the rainfall, the date for
which the rainfall is recorded, and the amount of rain in mm.
- Obviously, there must be some way of recording all this data in a container.
- There should be a way of graphing the data. Initially, only a bar graph and a column graph
are required. The data that is passed to the graphing application is an XML representation
of the container holding all the rainfall data.
- Clearly, then, there needs to be some way of getting an XML representation of the rain
record.
- The main client will be responsible for holding the record of all the rainfall data, for getting
the XML representation of all the rainfall data, and for passing this to the user’s choice of
graph.
- Appropriate design patterns should be used as necessary.

## Question 1
### Question 1.1:
Considering the scenario given above, draw a partial UML class diagram that captures
the scenario. You should include the necessary classes, class attributes, and class
relationships that are mentioned in the scenario. Class constructors and member access
specifiers are not required. However, you should ensure that you include all the data
members and member functions that show how data will be moved around the
application. You should include the Client/GUI class.
[You may use a software tool to create the UML class diagram. Use underlining to
represent italics in hand-drawn UML class diagrams.] (20 marks)

### Question 1.2:
It has been argued that the design pattern that would be used here is a behavioural
pattern. Do you agree, indicating which pattern would be used and why it is or is not a
behavioural pattern? (2 marks)

### Question 1.3:
It was decided to provide the class that holds the rain data with some reflective
functionality. That is, a `getData()` function should return a single data string that
contains all the data held by the class via the class’s meta-object, in a property named
data. This function is used only by the meta-object and should not be available to users
of the class.
Write the class definition for this class showing how this would be set up. You are not
required to include functionality or data members not mentioned above, or to code the
implementation of the `getData()` function. (3 marks)
---

## Question 2
Consider now the generation of the XML text that will be passed to the graphing applications.
The format for the XML text to be generated is the following.

```xml
<rainRecord>
    <rain date="2023/01/01">
        <station>AagA100</station>
        <mm>10</mm>
    </rain>
    <rain date="2023/01/02">
        <station>BcdB123</station>
        <mm>5</mm>
    </rain>
</rainRecord>
```

### Question 2.1:
If the date is stored as a `QDate` (say, `QDate date`), give the code you would use to
convert this data into the string format that is used in the XML text above? (2 marks)

### Question 2.2:
Suppose that a class named `RainXml` would be used to generate the XML text for all
the rain data.

```c++
class RainXml
{
public:
    RainXml();
    RainXml getInstance();
    QString writeToXml(/*passing rain data*/);
private:
    RainXml instance;
    bool checkStationCode(QString stn) const;
    QRegularExpression re;
};
```

This class is supposed to be implemented using a singleton design pattern.

### Question 2.2.1:
The class definition code provided above does not correctly implement the classic
singleton design pattern. Correct it so that it does. You are not expected to indicate the
container that is used to pass rain data. (3 marks)

### Question 2.2.2:
Would you agree with the decision to make this class use the singleton design pattern?
Explain your reason clearly and persuasively; note that marks are only allocated for the
reasoning. (2 marks)

### Question 2.3:
The `checkStationCode(QString stn)` function from the class definition in 2.2 is
used to ensure that the station code meets the correct format required, where the
`QString` parameter is the station code that needs checking. The returned Boolean is
true if the code meets requirements and `false` otherwise.

```c++
bool RainXml::checkStationCode(QString stn) const
{
    // add code here
}
```

The station code should meet the following requirements.
- Should begin with a capital letter.
- This is followed by any 2 lowercase alphabetic characters.
- This is followed by the same capital letter as the initial character of the code.
- The numeric part of the code is made up of any 3 digits, where the first digit cannot be zero.
- There should be no other characters before or after this code.

### Question 2.3.1:
Write the `QRegularExpression` that would be used to check codes for correctness.
`QRegularExpression re(/*what would you put here*/);` (7 marks)

### Question 2.3.2:
Which anti-pattern would be involved if the code were not checked for meeting
requirements? (1 marks)

### Question 2.3.3 Provide the code for the `checkStationCode(QString stn)` function assuming that
`QRegularExpression re`, defined in 2.3.1, is a data member of the `RainXml` class. (2 marks)

### Question 2.4:
The following code stub is used to generate the XML text given above. Using the required
XML format from the start of question 2, the `data` property from the meta-object from
1.3, and the `checkStationCode()` function from 2.3, complete the code where
indicated by comments.

Assume that each item of rain data can be obtained from the meta-object property set
up in 1.3 – it returns the data in the form: `StationCode:yyyy/mm/dd:mm`. For
example, if 10 mm of rain were received at station AagA100 on 1 January 2023, the data
would be in the form `AagA100:20230101:10`.

You are not required to provide the code for the `writeToXml()` function parameter or
the main loop that loops through all the rain records. You may assume that for each pass
through the loop, you have access to a pointer r that points to a rain record.

```c++
QString RainXml::writeToXml(/*passing rain data*/)
{
    QString xmlOutput;
    QXmlStreamWriter writer(&xmlOutput);
    // do initial setup of xml text
    // loop through each rain pointer named r (do not code this)
    {
        // use the meta-object to get the required data
        
        //if the station code passes the test
        {
        // set up the <rain> tag and its sub-tags as required
        }
    }
    // end xml text
    return xmlOutput;
}

```
 (13 marks)


The plan is to search the whole record of all rainfall data for a particular station’s data, and then
present this data on the client screen. This search should be done in a thread.
Consider the class implementation stub below (where stn is the station’s data that is required).

```c++
StationThread::StationThread(/*all data*/, QString stn)
    : record{/*all data*/}, station{stn}
{}

void StationThread::doSearch()
{
    foreach(/*rain record in the data*/)
    {
        //get the station, date, and mm as strings
        if (/*this station in the data*/ == station)
            emit foundStation(/*date as string*/, /*mm as string*/);
    }
}
```
---

## Question 3
### Question 3.1:
Write the class definition for the `StationThread` class, remembering that it should be run as a thread. (8 marks)

### Question 3.2:
Consider the code below that is run when data for a particular rain station is found by the
code running in the thread, where `QTableWidget *tableWidget` and `int row` have
already been declared and appropriately initialised.

```c++
void Client::handleFound(QString date, QString mm)
{
    QTableWidgetItem *dateItem{new QTableWidgetItem(date)};
    QTableWidgetItem *mmItem{new QTableWidgetItem(mm)};
    tableWidget->setItem(row, 0, dateItem);
    tableWidget->setItem(row++, 1, mmItem);
}
```

Assume the following code in `Client`.

```c++
QThread *t{new QThread};
StationThread *st{new StationThread(/*passing parameters*/)};
```

Write the code that would follow these declarations to get the thread running with the `StationThread` object, 
ensuring that the data is received from the running thread and passed on to the `handleFound()` function. (6 marks)

### Question 3.3:
Would you agree that the `QTableWidget` used in 3.2 is the best approach that can be
used for displaying a station’s rainfall data on the client window? Give reasons for your
answer. Note that marks are only allocated to your reasoning. (2 marks)

### Question 3.4:
As a way of managing a backup/restore functionality, it has been decided to subclass
the `QTableWidget` class to implement a classic memento design pattern. The start of
the class definition is provided below.

```c++
class MyTableWidget: public QTableWidget
{
private:
    friend class MyTableWidgetMemento;
    MyTableWidget();
    MyTableWidgetMemento* createMemento();
    void setMemento(MyTableWidgetMemento *m);
};
```

### Question 3.4.1:
What components usually make up the classic memento pattern, and which classes in
this scenario would represent those components? (3 marks)

### Question 3.4.2:
Explain why this implementation of the classic memento patten is correct or not. Marks
are only awarded for the explanation. (2 marks)

### Question 3.5:
It has been argued that cloud computing is the best way to go when it comes to managing
all the rainfall data. Explain why this would be so in terms of cost and scale. (4 marks)

### Question 1.1 (20 marks): UML Class Diagram

Given that we cannot generate images here, let's use a tree view to represent the UML class diagram.

```
1. RainData
    - station: QString
    - date: QDate
    - amount: double
    + getStation(): QString
    + getDate(): QDate
    + getAmount(): double
    + setData(QString, QDate, double): void
    + getData(): QString (meta-object only)

2. RainDataContainer
    - dataList: QList<RainData>
    + addData(RainData): void
    + getDataList(): QList<RainData>
    + toXml(): QString

3. Graph
    - type: QString ("Bar" or "Column")
    + setType(QString): void
    + getType(): QString
    + render(QString): void

4. Client
    - rainDataContainer: RainDataContainer
    - graph: Graph
    + addRainData(RainData): void
    + setGraphType(QString): void
    + displayGraph(): void
```

Relationships:
- `Client` has-a `RainDataContainer`
- `Client` has-a `Graph`
- `RainDataContainer` has-many `RainData`

![Jan-Feb-2023 Diagram.PNG](..%2FResources%2FJan-Feb-2023%20Diagram.PNG)

### Question 1.2 (2 marks): Design Pattern

I agree that a behavioral design pattern is appropriate here, specifically the Observer pattern. The Observer pattern would allow the `Client` class to observe changes in `RainDataContainer`. When new data is added to `RainDataContainer`, it notifies the `Client`, which then can update the graph.

Why it's a behavioral pattern:
- The Observer pattern is considered a behavioral pattern because it's used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Question 1.3 (3 marks): Class Definition for RainData

Here is the class definition for the `RainData` class that holds the rain data and includes the reflective functionality.

```cpp
#include <QString>
#include <QDate>

class RainData {
private:
    QString station;
    QDate date;
    double amount;

public:
    void setData(const QString& stn, const QDate& dt, double amt) {
        station = stn;
        date = dt;
        amount = amt;
    }

    QString getStation() const { return station; }
    QDate getDate() const { return date; }
    double getAmount() const { return amount; }

private:
    Q_PROPERTY(QString data READ getData)
    QString getData() const {
        // This function is used only by the meta-object
        return QString("%1:%2:%3").arg(station).arg(date.toString("yyyy/MM/dd")).arg(amount);
    }
};
```

I've used the `Q_PROPERTY` macro to define a read-only property named `data`, which will invoke the `getData()` function to get its value. This function is intended to be used only by the meta-object and is not public.

### Question 1.1 (20 marks): UML Class Diagram

```
1. RainData
    - station: QString
    - date: QDate
    - amount: double
    + getStation(): QString
    + getDate(): QDate
    + getAmount(): double
    + setData(QString, QDate, double): void
    + getData(): QString (meta-object only)

2. RainDataContainer
    - dataList: QList<RainData>
    + addData(RainData): void
    + getDataList(): QList<RainData>
    + toXml(): QString

3. Graph
    - type: QString ("Bar" or "Column")
    + setType(QString): void
    + getType(): QString
    + render(QString): void

4. Client
    - rainDataContainer: RainDataContainer
    - graph: Graph
    + addRainData(RainData): void
    + setGraphType(QString): void
    + displayGraph(): void
```

Relationships:
- `Client` has-a `RainDataContainer`
- `Client` has-a `Graph`
- `RainDataContainer` has-many `RainData`

### Question 1.2 (2 marks): Design Pattern

I agree that a behavioral design pattern is appropriate here, specifically the Observer pattern. The Observer pattern would allow the `Client` class to observe changes in `RainDataContainer`. When new data is added to `RainDataContainer`, it notifies the `Client`, which then can update the graph.

Why it's a behavioral pattern:
- The Observer pattern is considered a behavioral pattern because it's used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Question 1.3 (3 marks): Class Definition for RainData

Here is the class definition for the `RainData` class that holds the rain data and includes the reflective functionality.

```cpp
#include <QString>
#include <QDate>

class RainData {
private:
    QString station;
    QDate date;
    double amount;

public:
    void setData(const QString& stn, const QDate& dt, double amt) {
        station = stn;
        date = dt;
        amount = amt;
    }

    QString getStation() const { return station; }
    QDate getDate() const { return date; }
    double getAmount() const { return amount; }

private:
    Q_PROPERTY(QString data READ getData)
    QString getData() const {
        // This function is used only by the meta-object
        return QString("%1:%2:%3").arg(station).arg(date.toString("yyyy/MM/dd")).arg(amount);
    }
};
```

I've used the `Q_PROPERTY` macro to define a read-only property named `data`, which will invoke the `getData()` function to get its value. This function is intended to be used only by the meta-object and is not public.

### Question 2.1 (2 marks): Converting QDate to String for XML

To convert a `QDate` object to a string format suitable for XML, you can use the `toString` method provided by the `QDate` class.

```cpp
QDate date;  // Assume this is initialized
QString dateString = date.toString("yyyy-MM-dd");  // Converts to a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

### Question 2.2.1 (3 marks): Singleton Pattern for RainXml

The class definition provided does not correctly implement the Singleton pattern. Here is how it can be corrected.

```cpp
class RainXml {
private:
    static RainXml* instance;
    QRegularExpression re;

    RainXml() {}  // Private constructor

public:
    static RainXml* getInstance() {
        if (!instance) {
            instance = new RainXml();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    QString writeToXml(/*passing rain data*/);
    bool checkStationCode(QString stn) const;
};

// Initialize static member
RainXml* RainXml::instance = nullptr;
```

### Question 2.2.2 (2 marks): Singleton Decision

I agree with the decision to make the `RainXml` class a Singleton. This is because generating XML for rain data is a centralized operation that doesn't require multiple instances of the `RainXml` class. A single instance can manage the XML representation efficiently, ensuring that there is a single point of control.

### Question 2.3.1 (7 marks): QRegularExpression for Station Code

The QRegularExpression to check if the station code meets the given criteria would be as follows:

```cpp
QRegularExpression re("^[A-Z][a-z]{2}[A-Z][1-9][0-9]{2}$");
```

### Question 2.3.2 (1 mark): Anti-Pattern

If the station code were not checked for meeting requirements, it would be an example of the "Lack of Validation" anti-pattern, which can lead to various issues such as incorrect data processing and potential security vulnerabilities.

### Question 2.3.3 (2 marks): checkStationCode Function

Here is how the `checkStationCode` function could be implemented:

```cpp
bool RainXml::checkStationCode(QString stn) const {
    return re.match(stn).hasMatch();
}
```

### Question 2.4 (13 marks): writeToXml Function

Here is a stub for the `writeToXml` function, incorporating the required functionality:

```cpp
QString RainXml::writeToXml(/*passing rain data*/)
{
    QString xmlOutput;
    QXmlStreamWriter writer(&xmlOutput);
    writer.writeStartDocument();
    writer.writeStartElement("rainData");

    // Loop through each rain pointer named r (not coding this loop)
    {
        // Use the meta-object to get the required data
        QString data = r->getData();  // Assume r is a pointer to a RainData object

        // If the station code passes the test
        if (checkStationCode(data.split(":")[0])) {
            writer.writeStartElement("rain");

            writer.writeTextElement("station", data.split(":")[0]);
            writer.writeTextElement("date", data.split(":")[1]);
            writer.writeTextElement("amount", data.split(":")[2]);

            writer.writeEndElement();  // End of "rain"
        }
    }

    writer.writeEndElement();  // End of "rainData"
    writer.writeEndDocument();

    return xmlOutput;
}
```

---

### Question 3.1 (8 marks): StationThread Class Definition

To run the `StationThread` class as a thread in Qt, you can subclass `QRunnable` or `QThread`. Here, I'll use `QThread` for demonstration.

```cpp
#include <QThread>
#include <QString>
#include <QList>

class StationThread : public QThread
{
    Q_OBJECT
private:
    QList<RainData> record;  // Assume RainData is the class that holds individual rain records
    QString station;

public:
    StationThread(const QList<RainData>& allData, const QString& stn)
        : record(allData), station(stn) {}

    void run() override {
        doSearch();
    }

    void doSearch();

signals:
    void foundStation(QString date, QString mm);
};
```

### Question 3.2 (6 marks): Thread Execution and Signal Handling

The following code will set up the thread and connect its signals.

```cpp
QThread* t = new QThread;
StationThread* st = new StationThread(/*passing parameters*/);

st->moveToThread(t);

connect(st, &StationThread::foundStation, &Client::handleFound);
connect(t, &QThread::started, st);
connect(t, &QThread::finished, t, &QThread::deleteLater);

t->start();
```

### Question 3.3 (2 marks): QTableWidget Decision

Yes, I agree that using `QTableWidget` is a suitable approach for displaying the station's rainfall data. It's a high-level API that provides built-in functionality for item selection, sorting, and other common requirements, which saves development time. Also, it allows easy mapping of data to rows and columns, which is quite intuitive for the user.

### Question 3.4.1 (3 marks): Classic Memento Pattern Components

The classic memento pattern usually consists of three main components: 
- Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored. (`MyTableWidget` in this case)
- Memento: The object that actually stores the state of the Originator. (`MyTableWidgetMemento`)
- Caretaker: The object that keeps track of multiple memento. (Could be a `BackupManager` class or the `Client` class in this scenario)

### Question 3.4.2 (2 marks): Memento Pattern Implementation

The implementation appears to be on the right track for applying the Memento pattern. The `MyTableWidget` class (the Originator) has methods to create and set a memento (`MyTableWidgetMemento`). However, without seeing the implementation of these methods and the `MyTableWidgetMemento` class, it's hard to definitively say if the pattern is correctly implemented.

### Question 3.5 (4 marks): Cloud Computing for Rainfall Data Management

Utilizing cloud computing for managing all the rainfall data would be advantageous in terms of both cost and scale:

- **Cost-Efficiency**: Cloud services often operate on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the storage and computational power you actually use. This eliminates the upfront cost of setting up and maintaining physical servers.
  
- **Scalability**: Cloud platforms can easily adapt to changing needs. If more storage or computational power is needed, it can be added instantly without the need to purchase and set up additional physical hardware.
